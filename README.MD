This is the volunteer App I made for the NHS division for Vhacks, a hackathon held by Vernon Hills high School 
I designed the app using expo react-native and used Firebase Database and authentication to store and authenticate NHS users and volunteer hours, 
I built and customized a calendar as well to be able to allow users to view and sign up for volunteer events.
