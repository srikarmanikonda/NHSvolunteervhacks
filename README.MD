This is a volunteer cross-platform mobile App I made for the NHS division for Vhacks, a hackathon held by Vernon Hills high School 

I designed the app using Expo react-native and used Firebase Database and authentication to store and authenticate NHS users and volunteer hours.

I also built and customized a calendar as well to be able to allow users to view and sign up for volunteer events. I used Expo's calendar authentication API to save calendar events in the device calendar and push notifcations + reminders were handled from there.
